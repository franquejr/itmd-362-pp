# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742471(v=vs.85).aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
Our LogIn will contain text at the bottom of the password input and display a specific message to help the user know what is the issue rather than a series of possible solutions. For example one alert will tell user to enter their full ITT email rather than just the user name
Another alert will display if the user name or password are the problem. Rather than a credential error message
* HCI Guidline Two (URL):
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742404(v=vs.85).aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
Our page will contain a drop down menu with possible schedule choices. Hiding choices with a drop down menu will save valuable space on smaller devices
* HCI Guidline Three (URL):
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742486.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
Will the help of media queries, our navigation bar links will be aligned center while the screen is a larger size. At smaller size the links will be set to align-left, allowing the user to easily scan the contents
