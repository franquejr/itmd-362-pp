# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1.https://stayintech.com/info/UX
2.https://wsuwp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/7/2015/08/25-point-usability-checklist-final.pdf

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1.Links, buttons and checkboxes are easily clickable
2.Links are easily recognizable.
3.Consistency. Page layouts are consistent across the whole website.
4.Fields are labeled with common terms, e.g. Name, Address (supports autofill).
5.Images and videos are relevant and meaningful.
6.Page layout is clear with a sufficient amount of white space
7.The destination of navigation links is predictable (delivers the 
visitor to the promised content on the correct page)
8.Users can easily return to the home page or relevant starting 
point and can easily exit from all pages
9.The userâ€™s current location is always identified, following the 
WSU template standard
10.Keywords or terms are front-loaded in paragraphs and lists to 
assist scannability. Eye tracking studies show readers scan down 
the left side of content rather than reading it.
